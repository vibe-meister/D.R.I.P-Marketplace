## Security Considerations

### Wallet Security
- **Never share your private keys or seed phrases**
- **Always verify wallet addresses before transactions**
- **Use hardware wallets for large amounts**
- **Keep your MetaMask updated**

### Platform Security
- **All payments go to the platform wallet first**: `0x39d36a64a1e16e52d8353eff82ace7c96502f269`
- **Content access is wallet-specific**: Only the purchasing wallet can access content
- **No private keys are stored**: We only store wallet addresses
- **JWT tokens expire**: Authentication tokens have expiration dates

### Best Practices
- **Use HTTPS**: Always use secure connections

- **Validate inputs**: All user inputs are validated
- **Rate limiting**: API endpoints have rate limits
- **CORS protection**: Cross-origin requests are controlled
